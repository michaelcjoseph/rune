 * Work-run persistence (project 11, Phase 2 — run store).

 * Two durable artifacts beyond the transcript:
 *   - `summary.json` per run (outcome facts), written temp-then-rename so a
 *     crash never leaves a half-written file (mirrors `writeAllRuns` in
 *     supervision-store.ts).
 *   - `index.jsonl`, the rolling recent-runs index; readers tolerate a torn
 *     trailing line (the skip-malformed pattern from `readRecentMutations`).
 *
 * Implemented; the remaining Phase 2 work is the caller wiring (work-runner
 * writes summary.json + the index row before the terminal event).
